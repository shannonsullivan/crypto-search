# Cryptocurrency Price Tracker

React cryptocurrency price tracker with a search feature to display currency details. 

State and effect hooks used with Axios to make HTTP requests to fetch data from public API. 

The currency's total volume, price, 24hr price change and market cap are updated when page is 
refreshed. 

This app was created with help from a tutorial to learn React using Axios to send HTTP request to REST endpoints by [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKsymTY_4BYR-wytLjex7A)
