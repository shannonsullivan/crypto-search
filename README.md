# Cryptocurrency Price Tracker

React JS cryptocurrency price tracker with a search feature to display currency details. 
State and effect hooks used with Axios to make HTTP requests to fetch data from public API. The 
currency's total volume, price, 24hr price change and market cap are updated when page is 
refreshed. If the 24hr price change is negative, the percent will display red and if it's positive it's green.
